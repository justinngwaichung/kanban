### Description:

A website where users can create a project, then a list of tasks for that project. The tasks are then organized via the Kanban Method.

Tasks are assigned to one of 4 categories: to-do, in progress, completed, reviewed.

Users can move tasks between the 4 categories.

Deleting a project, automatically deleted all tasks associated with that project.

### Technologies Used:

Backend: Django

Database: SQLite

Website Deployment: PythonAnywhere

### Major Challenges:

Web Deployment

Front-end and back-end interaction

Learning the nitty-gritty of full-stack development

Figuring out CSS for viewing on mobile devices


### Potential features for future use:

User logins / logouts

Moving away from local databases

Project should autocomplete once all tasks in given project are completed
